<strong>Why I created this  </strong>

Project Title: Kids' Interactive Learning Webpage

Project Description:
The Kids' Interactive Learning Webpage is a project designed to engage and educate young children while their parents work on their laptops. The webpage provides an interactive and entertaining experience for kids, allowing them to learn letters, sounds, and associated images through a simple key-press interaction.

Features:
1. User-Friendly Interface: The webpage has a visually appealing and intuitive design, specifically created to attract and engage young children.
2. Interactive Keyboard: The webpage responds to key presses on the keyboard, triggering corresponding sounds and displaying relevant images.
3. Audio Feedback: Upon pressing a key, the webpage generates the corresponding sound to reinforce the association between letters and sounds.
4. Visual Feedback: Alongside the audio feedback, the webpage displays an image related to the pressed key's associated word, helping children visually connect the letter to its representation.
5. Brief Display Time: The displayed image remains on the screen for a short duration, ensuring that children stay engaged and excited to explore more letters.
6. Multiple Letter-Sound Associations: Each key on the keyboard is linked to a unique letter-sound association, exposing children to various words and corresponding images.

Technologies Used:
1. HTML5: Used to structure the webpage's content and elements.
2. CSS3: Employed to enhance the visual appeal of the webpage, providing attractive styles and animations.
3. JavaScript: Implemented to capture key presses, play sounds, display images, and manage the interactive behavior of the webpage.

Outcome:
The Kids' Interactive Learning Webpage combines entertainment and education, providing a safe and engaging online space for young children. By incorporating interactive elements, audio-visual feedback, and an intuitive user interface, the webpage offers an immersive learning experience that can captivate and educate children while their parents work.	


  <strong>How to use this</strong>

  Download the zip file containing the game.
1)Unzip the folder to extract its contents.
2)Locate the index.html file and double-click on it to open it in your web browser.

To customize the game for your child, you can change the image and audio associated with each letter. Follow these instructions:

Navigate to the img folder within the extracted folder.
Replace the existing image with the new image you want to use. Make sure the image file format is supported (PNG).
Rename the new image file to match the letter you want to associate it with (e.g., b.png for the letter "B").
Similarly, go to the audio folder and replace the audio file with the desired audio for the corresponding letter. Ensure the audio file is in a compatible format (e.g., MP3).
Rename the new audio file to match the letter (e.g., b.mp3 for the letter "B").
By following these steps, when your child presses a button corresponding to a letter, they will see the new image and hear the updated audio that you have chosen.

Please note that although this implementation lacks a backend, it provides a basic interactive experience for your child.

This project serves as an example of my front-end development skills and my ability to create educational and user-friendly web applications. It demonstrates my understanding of HTML, file organization, and customization.
