Download the zip file containing the game.
1)Unzip the folder to extract its contents.
2)Locate the index.html file and double-click on it to open it in your web browser.

To customize the game for your child, you can change the image and audio associated with each letter. Follow these instructions:

Navigate to the img folder within the extracted folder.
Replace the existing image with the new image you want to use. Make sure the image file format is supported (PNG).
Rename the new image file to match the letter you want to associate it with (e.g., b.png for the letter "B").
Similarly, go to the audio folder and replace the audio file with the desired audio for the corresponding letter. Ensure the audio file is in a compatible format (e.g., MP3).
Rename the new audio file to match the letter (e.g., b.mp3 for the letter "B").
By following these steps, when your child presses a button corresponding to a letter, they will see the new image and hear the updated audio that you have chosen.

Please note that although this implementation lacks a backend, it provides a basic interactive experience for your child.
